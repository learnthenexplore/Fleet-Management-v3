# üßÆ Monthly Measurement Schema

The `Measurement` schema stores **monthly material measurement settings** used to calculate production quantities per trip.  
It maintains separate units and approximate values for both **coal** and **overburden (OB)**, which may change monthly.

---

## üîë Key Fields & Descriptions

### 1. **Month Identifier**

- `effectiveMonth` *(String, required, unique)*  
  Format: `'YYYY-MM'` (e.g., `'2025-08'`)  
  Defines the month for which the measurement values are effective.  
  Used to determine which values to apply during trip logging.

---

### 2. **Material Configurations**

Both `coal` and `ob` follow the same sub-schema:

#### materialSubSchema:
- `approxPerTrip` *(Number, required)*  
  Approximate quantity (in unit) transported in **one trip**.

- `unit` *(String, required)*  
  Unit of measurement:
  - `MT` = Metric Ton (for coal)
  - `BCM` = Bank Cubic Meter (for OB)

> üí° This structure allows dynamic configuration for each month and material type.

---

### 3. **Metadata & Audit**

- `updatedBy` *(ObjectId, optional)*  
  Reference to the `Employee` who last updated the measurement.

- `remarks` *(String, optional)*  
  Notes or explanation for the change (e.g., change in equipment capacity or contractor agreement).

- `active` *(Boolean, default: true)*  
  Marks whether this measurement is currently active.  
  Only **one record per month** should be active for system calculations.

- `createdAt`, `updatedAt` *(Timestamps)*  
  Automatically managed by Mongoose.

});

export default mongoose.model('Notification', notificationSchema);

```

# üîî Notification Schema

The `Notification` schema stores in-app system messages triggered by various events like trip creation, breakdowns, fuel logs, or employee actions.  
It supports filtering by user roles, tracks read status, and links to related models for context.

---

## üîë Key Fields & Descriptions

### 1. **Core Event Info**

- `eventType` *(String, required)*  
  The event that triggered the notification. Must be one of:
  - `EMPLOYEE_ADDED`
  - `VEHICLE_ASSIGNED`
  - `TRIP_STARTED`
  - `BREAKDOWN_REPORTED`
  - `BREAKDOWN_ACCEPTED`
  - `BREAKDOWN_RESOLVED`
  - `PRODUCTION_UPDATED`
  - `FUELING_UPDATED`

- `title` *(String, required)*  
  Short heading or label for the notification (e.g., "New Trip Started").

- `message` *(String, required)*  
  Detailed message or description explaining the event.

---

### 2. **Audience Control**

- `viewScopes` *(Array of Strings)*  
  Specifies who can see the notification. Can include any of:
  - `DRIVER_VIEW`
  - `MANAGEMENT_VIEW`
  - `MECHANIC_VIEW`
  - `EXECUTIVE_VIEW`
  - `FUEL_VIEW`
  - `PRODUCTION_VIEW`

> üîê These scopes allow targeting notifications to specific roles.

---

### 3. **Model Linking**

- `relatedModel` *(String, optional)*  
  The model type the notification is related to (e.g., `'Trip'`, `'Breakdown'`, `'Vehicle'`).

- `relatedId` *(ObjectId, optional)*  
  The ID of the related model instance (used for navigation or reference).

---

### 4. **Read Tracking**

- `isReadBy` *(Array of ObjectIds)*  
  List of `Employee` IDs who have already read the notification.

---

### 5. **Timestamps**

- `createdAt` *(Date, default: now)*  
  Timestamp when the notification was created.
